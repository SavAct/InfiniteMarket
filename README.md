# Infinite Market
An online marketplace for physical goods that needs no central authority.
The frontend and the backend are stored on blockchain and therefor for free for ever online.

# Physical Goods
Usually, it is a big problem to connect the virtual world of blockchain with actions in the physical world without implementing central authorities. Only the fraud protection mechanism of Savact can handle that without any third party. It is free to use and fully integrated into payments within this marketplace to achieve a smooth user experience.

# No Server Costs
The backend is based on a smart contract running on the blockchain. What's unique, however, is that the entire frontend is also stored on-chain. This approach eliminates the need for conventional web hosting solutions like IPFS or self-hosted servers, removing associated costs and maintenance requirements. Once uploaded to the blockchain, the application remains accessible as long as the blockchain exists. It relies on the SavWeb technology, which operates as a static HTML file compatible with any standard web browser.

# Independent
The technologies employed enable completely independent online trading, eliminating costs for any service providers and keeping your private data with you. By avoiding fees for the marketplace or escrow services, merchants can achieve higher profits and offer items at lower prices.
